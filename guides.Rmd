# Guides: legends and axes {#guides}

In Chapter \@ref(scales) I discussed the way a scale maps a variable to an aesthetic. This chapter is a natural extension of the last and discusses the role scales play in controlling the __guide__ (the axis or legend associated with the scale). Guides allow you to read observations from the plot and map them back to their original values. In ggplot2, guides are produced automatically based on the layers in your plot. This is very different to base R graphics, where you are responsible for drawing the legends by hand. In ggplot2, you don't directly control the legend; instead you set up the data so that there's a clear mapping between data and aesthetics, and a legend is generated for you automatically. This can be frustrating when you first start using ggplot2, but once you get the hang of it, you'll find that it saves you time, and there is little you cannot do. If you're struggling to get the legend you want, it's likely that your data is in the wrong form. 

You might find it surprising that axes and legends are the same type of thing, but while they look very different there are many natural correspondences between the two, as shown in table below and in Figure \@ref(fig:guides). \index{Guides} \index{Legend} \index{Axis}

```{r guides, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Axis and legend components."}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/scale-guides.png", dpi = 300, auto_pdf = TRUE)
```


| Axis              | Legend        | Argument name
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------
| Label             | Title         | `name`          
| Ticks & grid line | Key           | `breaks`        
| Tick label        | Key label     | `labels`        


The early sections of this chapter highlight functionality that is shared by axes and legends. Section \@ref(scale-name) discusses the `name` argument, while Section \@ref(breaks-labels) covers the `breaks` and `labels` arguments in more detail. However, legends are more complicated than axes because:

1.  A legend can display multiple aesthetics (e.g. colour and shape), from
    multiple layers, and the symbol displayed in a legend varies based on the
    geom used in the layer.
   
1.  Axes always appear in the same place. Legends can appear in different 
    places, so you need some global way of controlling them.
  
1.  Legends have considerably more details that can be tweaked: should they
    be displayed vertically or horizontally? How many columns? How big should
    the keys be?
    
As a consequence there are some extra options that only apply to legends, and the later sections in the chapter focus on this legend-specific behaviour.
    

## Scale names {#scale-name}

The first argument to the scale function, `name`, is the axes/legend title. You can supply text strings (using `\n` for line breaks) or mathematical expressions in `quote()` (as described in `?plotmath`):  \index{Axis!title} \index{Legend!title}
    
`r columns(2, 1 / 2)`
```{r guide-names}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 1, z = "a")
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()

p + scale_x_continuous("X axis")
p + scale_x_continuous(quote(a + mathematical ^ expression))
```

Because tweaking these labels is such a common task, there are three 
helpers that save you some typing: `xlab()`, `ylab()` and `labs()`:

```{r guide-names-helper}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(aes(colour = z))
p + 
  xlab("X axis") + 
  ylab("Y axis")
p + labs(x = "X axis", y = "Y axis", colour = "Colour\nlegend")
```

There are two ways to remove the axis label. Setting it to `""` omits the label, but still allocates space; `NULL` removes the label and its space. Look closely at the left and bottom borders of the following two plots. I've drawn a grey rectangle around the plot to make it easier to see the difference.

```{r guide-names-remove}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(colour = "grey50"))
p + labs(x = "",  y = "")
p + labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
```

## Scale breaks and labels {#breaks-labels}

The `breaks` argument controls which values appear as tick marks on axes and keys on legends. Each break has an associated label, controlled by the `labels` argument. If you set `labels`, you must also set `breaks`; otherwise, if data changes, the breaks will no longer align with the labels. \index{Axis!ticks} \index{Axis!breaks} \index{Axis!labels} \index{Legend!keys}

The following code shows some basic examples for both axes and legends.

`r columns(3, 2/3)`
```{r breaks-labels}
df <- data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5) * 1000, y = 1)
axs <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

axs
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000))
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000), labels = c("2k", "4k"))
```

```{r}
leg <- ggplot(df, aes(y, x, fill = x)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

leg
leg + scale_fill_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000))
leg + scale_fill_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000), labels = c("2k", "4k"))
```

If you want to relabel the breaks in a categorical scale, you can use a named labels vector:

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))

ggplot(df2, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point()
ggplot(df2, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c(a = "apple", b = "banana", c = "carrot"))
```

To suppress breaks (and for axes, grid lines) or labels, set them to `NULL`:

```{r axs-breaks-hide}
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL)
axs + scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL)
```
```{r leg-breaks-hide}
leg + scale_fill_continuous(breaks = NULL)
leg + scale_fill_continuous(labels = NULL)
```

### Break and label functions

Additionally, you can supply a function to `breaks` or `labels`. The `breaks` function should have one argument, the limits (a numeric vector of length two), and should return a numeric vector of breaks. The `labels` function should accept a numeric vector of breaks and return a character vector of labels (the same length as the input). The scales package provides a number of useful labelling functions:

* `scales::comma_format()` adds commas to make it easier to read large numbers.

* `scales::unit_format(unit, scale)` adds a unit suffix, optionally scaling.

* `scales::dollar_format(prefix, suffix)` displays currency values, rounding 
   to two decimal places and adding a prefix or suffix.

* `scales::wrap_format()` wraps long labels into multiple lines.

See the documentation of the scales package for more details.

`r columns(3)`
```{r breaks-functions}
axs + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())
axs + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = "$"))
leg + scale_fill_continuous(labels = scales::unit_format(unit = "k", scale = 1e-3))
```

You can adjust the minor breaks (the faint grid lines that appear between the major grid lines) by supplying a numeric vector of positions to the `minor_breaks` argument. This is particularly useful for log scales: \index{Minor breaks}

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = c(2, 3, 5, 10, 200, 3000), y = 1)
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10()

mb <- as.numeric(1:10 %o% 10 ^ (0:4))
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10(minor_breaks = mb)
```

Note the use of `%o%` to quickly generate the multiplication table, and that the minor breaks must be supplied on the transformed scale. \index{Log!ticks}


### Date scales {#date-scales}

A special case of interest occurs when an aesthetic is mapped to date or date/time data. In ggplot2 these are treated as continuous variables that have special labels, and there are some helper functions designed to make it easier to specify the breaks and labels for these scales. The ggplot2 package supports the `Date` (for dates) and `POSIXct` (for date/times) classes, as well as the `hms` class provided by the hms package [@hms]. If your dates are in a different format you will need to convert them using `as.Date()`, `as.POSIXct()` or `hms::as_hms()`. You may also find the toolkit provided by the lubridate package helpful to manipulate time and date data [@lubridate].


For appropriately formatted data mapped to the x aesthetic, ggplot2 will default to `scale_x_date()` and `scale_x_datetime()`, and there are similar scales for other aesthetics. In most respects date scales behave the same way as other continuous scales, but have some special behaviour that is worth noting. Specifically, in addition to the usual `breaks` and `labels` arguments, date scales have special `date_breaks` and `date_labels` arguments that allow you to work in date-friendly units:
\index{Date/times} \index{Data!date/time} \index{Time} \index{Scales!date/time} \indexf{scale\_x\_datetime}

*   `date_breaks` and `date_minor_breaks()` allows you to position breaks by
    date units (years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds). 
    For example, `date_breaks = "2 weeks"` will place a major 
    tick mark every two weeks.

*   `date_labels` controls the display of the labels
    using the same formatting strings as in `strptime()` and `format()`:

    | String        | Meaning
    |---------------|-----------------------------------------
    | `%S`          | second (00-59)
    | `%M`          | minute (00-59)
    | `%l`          | hour, in 12-hour clock (1-12)
    | `%I`          | hour, in 12-hour clock (01-12)
    | `%p`          | am/pm
    | `%H`          | hour, in 24-hour clock (00-23)
    | `%a`          | day of week, abbreviated (Mon-Sun)
    | `%A`          | day of week, full (Monday-Sunday)
    | `%e`          | day of month (1-31)
    | `%d`          | day of month (01-31)
    | `%m`          | month, numeric (01-12)
    | `%b`          | month, abbreviated (Jan-Dec)
    | `%B`          | month, full (January-December)
    | `%y`          | year, without century (00-99)
    | `%Y`          | year, with century (0000-9999)

    For example, if you wanted to display dates like 14/10/1979, you would use 
    the string `"%d/%m/%Y"`.

The code below illustrates some of these parameters.

`r columns(2, 1 / 2)`
```{r date-scale}
base <- ggplot(economics, aes(date, psavert)) + 
  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)

base 
base + scale_x_date(date_labels = "%y", date_breaks = "5 years")
```

```{r date-scale-2}
base + scale_x_date(
  limits = as.Date(c("2004-01-01", "2005-01-01")),
  date_labels = "%b %y",
  date_minor_breaks = "1 month"
)
base + scale_x_date(
  limits = as.Date(c("2004-01-01", "2004-06-01")),
  date_labels = "%m/%d",
  date_minor_breaks = "2 weeks"
)
```

## Scale guides

The previous sections describe features of ggplot2 that are the same for both axes and legend, but because legends are more complex than axes, there are additional topics to discuss that pertain only (or mostly) to legends. ggplot2 is designed so that in most cases the default legends will be sensible, but even so it is often necessary to override the defaults. You can do this using the `guide` argument of the corresponding scale function, or more conveniently, the `guides()` helper function. 

The `guides()` helper works in a similar way to the `labs()` helper function described in Section \@ref(scale-name) both take the name of different aesthetics (e.g., color, x, fill) as arguments and allow you to specify your own value. Where `labs()` provides a shorthand way to specify the `name` argument to one or more scales, the `guides()` function allows you to specify `guide` arguments to one or more scales. In the same way that `labs(colour = "a colour scale name")` specifies the name associated with the colour scale, a command such as `guides(colour = guide_coloursteps())` can be used to specify its associated guide:

`r columns(3)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = cyl)) + geom_point()

base 
base + scale_colour_continuous(guide = guide_coloursteps())
base + guides(colour = guide_coloursteps())
```

However, scale guides are more complex than scale names: where the `name` argument (and hence the `labs()` helper function) takes text as input, the `guide` argument (and `guides()` helper) expect you to create a guide object using a **guide function** such as `guide_colourbar()` and `guide_legend()`. These functions offer the user additional control over the fine details of the legend. Legend guides can be used for any aesthetic (discrete or continuous) while the colour bar guide can only be used with continuous colour scales. 


The guide functions have numerous examples in their documentation help pages that illustrate all of their arguments. Most of the arguments to the guide function control the fine level details of the text colour, size, font etc. You'll learn about those in the themes chapter. Here I'll focus on the most important arguments.

### `guide_legend()`

The legend guide displays individual keys in a table. The most useful options are: \index{Legend!guide}

*   `nrow` or `ncol` which specify the dimensions of the table. `byrow` 
    controls how the table is filled: `FALSE` fills it by column (the default),
    `TRUE` fills it by row.

    `r columns(3)`
    ```{r legend-rows-cols}
    base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, fill = factor(cyl))) + geom_bar() 

    base
    base + guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2))
    base + guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
    ```

*   `reverse` reverses the order of the keys:
    
    ```{r}
    base
    base + guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))
    ```

*   `override.aes` is useful when you want the elements in the legend 
    display differently to the geoms in the plot. This is often required
    when you've used transparency or size to deal with moderate overplotting
    and also used colour in the plot. \indexf{override.aes}

    `r columns(2, 2/3)`
    ```{r}
    base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = drv)) +
      geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .2, stroke = 0)
    
    base + guides(colour = guide_legend())
    base + guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
    ```


*   `keywidth` and `keyheight` (along with `default.unit`) allow you to specify
    the size of the keys. These are grid units, e.g. `unit(1, "cm")`.

### `guide_bins()`

The `guide_bins()` function is suited to the situation when a continuous variable is binned and then mapped to an aesthetic that produces a legend, such as size, colour and fill. For instance, in the `mpg` data we could use `scale_size_binned()` to create a binned version of the continuous variable `hwy`. 

`r columns(2, 1)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, manufacturer, size = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  scale_size_binned()
```

Unlike `guide_legend()`, the guide created for a binned scale by `guide_bins()` does not organise the individual keys into a table. Instead they are arranged in a column (or row) along a single vertical (or horizontal) axis, which by default is displayed with its own axis. The important arguments to `guide_bins()` are listed below:

*   `axis` indicates whether the axis should be drawn (default is `TRUE`).

    ```{r}
    base
    base + guides(size = guide_bins(axis = FALSE))
    ```

*   `direction` is a character string specifying the direction of the guide:

    ```{r}
    base + guides(size = guide_bins(direction = "vertical"))
    base + guides(size = guide_bins(direction = "horizontal"))
    ```

*   `show.limits` specifies whether tick marks are shown at the ends of the guide axis

*   `axis.colour`, `axis.linewidth` and `axis.arrow` are used to
    control the guide axis that is displayed alongside the legend keys 

    ```{r}
    base + guides(size = guide_bins(show.limits = TRUE))
    base + guides(
      size = guide_bins(
        axis.colour = "red",
        axis.arrow = arrow(
          length = unit(.1, "inches"), 
          ends = "first", 
          type = "closed"
        )
      )
    )
    ```

*   `keywidth`, `keyheight`, `reverse` and `override.aes` have the same
  behaviour for `guide_bins()` 

### `guide_colourbar`

The colour bar guide is designed for continuous ranges of colors---as its name implies, it outputs a rectangle over which the color gradient varies.  The most important arguments are: \index{Legend!colour bar} \index{Colour bar}

* `barwidth` and `barheight` (along with `default.unit`) allow you to specify
   the size of the bar. These are grid units, e.g. `unit(1, "cm")`.
  
* `nbin` controls the number of slices. You may want to increase this from
  the default value of 20 if you draw a very long bar.

* `reverse` flips the colour bar to put the lowest values at the top.

These options are illustrated below:

`r columns(3)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cyl, displ, colour = hwy)) +
  geom_point(size = 2)

base
base + guides(colour = guide_colourbar(reverse = TRUE))
base + guides(colour = guide_colourbar(barheight = unit(1, "cm")))
```

### `guide_coloursteps()`

This "colour steps" guide is a version of `guide_colourbar()` appropriate for binned colour and fill scales. It shows the area between breaks as a single constant colour, rather than displaying a colour gradient that varies smoothly along the bar. Arguments mostly mirror those for `guide_colourbar()`. The additional arguments are as follows:

*   `show.limits` indicates whether values should be shown at the ends of the stepped colour bar (analogous to the corresponding argument in `guide_bins()`)

    `r columns(2)`
    ```{r}
    base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = cyl)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      scale_color_binned()

    base + guides(colour = guide_coloursteps(show.limits = TRUE))
    base + guides(colour = guide_coloursteps(show.limits = FALSE))
    ```

*   `ticks` is a logical variable indicating whether tick marks should be displayed adjacent to the legend labels (default is `NULL`, in which case the value is inherited from the scale)

*   `even.steps` is a logical variable indicating whether bins should be evenly spaced (default is `TRUE`) or proportional in size to their frequency in the data



### `guide_axis()`

Guide functions exist mostly to control plot legends, but---as legends and axes are both kinds of guide---ggplot2 also supplies a `guide_axis()` function for axes. Its main purpose is to modify thematic properties:

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer, hwy)) + geom_boxplot() 
ggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer, hwy)) + geom_boxplot() + 
  guides(x = guide_axis(angle = 90))
```

### `guide_none()`

The final guide function is `guide_none()`, in which no guide is drawn for the relevant aesthetic.


## Legend merging and splitting

One of the major differences between legends and axes is that a legend may need to draw symbols from multiple layers ("merging" legends). On occasions multiple legends may need to be associated with the same aesthetic ("splitting" a legend). In this section I cover both topics.

### Merging legends {#sub-layers-legends}
\index{Legend}

Merging legends occurs quite frequently when using ggplot2. For example, if you've mapped colour to both points and lines, the keys will show both points and lines. If you've mapped fill colour, you get a rectangle. Note the way the legend varies in the plots below:

`r columns(3)`
```{r legend-geom, echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 1:3, z = letters[1:3])
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y, colour = z))
p + geom_point()
p + geom_point() + geom_path(aes(group = 1))
p + geom_raster(aes(fill = z))
```

By default, a layer will only appear if the corresponding aesthetic is mapped to a variable with `aes()`. You can override whether or not a layer appears in the legend with `show.legend`: `FALSE` to prevent a layer from ever appearing in the legend; `TRUE` forces it to appear when it otherwise wouldn't. Using `TRUE` can be useful in conjunction with the following trick to make points stand out:

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 1:3, z = letters[1:3])
ggplot(df, aes(y, y)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, colour = "grey20") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 2) 
ggplot(df, aes(y, y)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, colour = "grey20", show.legend = TRUE) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 2) 
```

ggplot2 tries to use the fewest number of legends to accurately convey the aesthetics used in the plot. It does this by combining legends where the same variable is mapped to different aesthetics. The figure below shows how this works for points: if both colour and shape are mapped to the same variable, then only a single legend is necessary. \index{Legend!merging}

`r columns(3)`
```{r legend-merge}
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(aes(colour = z))
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(aes(shape = z))
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(aes(shape = z, colour = z))
```

In order for legends to be merged, they must have the same `name`. So if you change the name of one of the scales, you'll need to change it for all of them.


### Splitting legends

Splitting a legend is a much less common data visualisation task. In general it is not advisable to map one aesthetic (e.g. colour) to multiple variables, and so by default ggplot2 does not allow you to "split" the colour aesthetic into multiple scales with separate legends. Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this general rule, and it is possible to override this behaviour using the ggnewscale package [@ggnewscale]. The `ggnewscale::new_scale_colour()` command acts as an instruction to ggplot2 to initialise a new colour scale: scale and guide commands that appear above the `new_scale_colour()` command will be applied to the first colour scale, and commands that appear below are applied to the second colour scale. 

To illustrate this the plot on the left uses `geom_point()` to display a large marker for each vehicle make in the `mpg` data, with a single colour scale that maps to the year. On the right, a second `geom_point()` layer is overlaid on the plot using small markers: this layer is associated with a different colour scale, used to indicate whether the vehicle has a 4-cylinder engine.

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = factor(year)), size = 5) + 
  scale_colour_brewer("year", type = "qual", palette = 5) 

base
base + 
  ggnewscale::new_scale_colour() + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = cyl == 4), size = 1, fill = NA) + 
  scale_colour_manual("4 cylinder", values = c("grey60", "black"))
```





## Legend positioning {#legend-layout}

A number of settings that affect the overall display of the legends are controlled through the theme system. You'll learn more about that in Section \@ref(themes), but for now, all you need to know is that you modify theme settings with the `theme()` function. \index{Themes!legend} 

The position and justification of legends are controlled by the theme setting `legend.position`, which takes values "right", "left", "top", "bottom", or "none" (no legend). \index{Legend!layout}

`r columns(3, 2/3)`
```{r legend-position}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 1:3, z = c("a", "b", "c"))
base <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 3) + 
  xlab(NULL) + 
  ylab(NULL)

base + theme(legend.position = "right") # the default 
base + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
base + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Switching between left/right and top/bottom modifies how the keys in each legend are laid out (horizontal or vertically), and how multiple legends are stacked (horizontal or vertically). If needed, you can adjust those options independently:

* `legend.direction`: layout of items in legends ("horizontal" or "vertical").

* `legend.box`: arrangement of multiple legends ("horizontal" or "vertical").

* `legend.box.just`: justification of each legend within the overall bounding 
   box, when there are multiple legends ("top", "bottom", "left", or "right").

Alternatively, if there's a lot of blank space in your plot you might want to place the legend inside the plot. You can do this by setting `legend.position` to a numeric vector of length two. The numbers represent a relative location in the panel area: `c(0, 1)` is the top-left corner and `c(1, 0)` is the bottom-right corner. You control which corner of the legend the `legend.position` refers to with `legend.justification`, which is specified in a similar way. Unfortunately positioning the legend exactly where you want it requires a lot of trial and error.

`r columns(3, 1)`
```{r legend-position-man}
base <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 3)

base + theme(legend.position = c(0, 1), legend.justification = c(0, 1))
base + theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 0.5), legend.justification = c(0.5, 0.5))
base + theme(legend.position = c(1, 0), legend.justification = c(1, 0))
```

There's also a margin around the legends, which you can suppress with `legend.margin = unit(0, "mm")`.

## Legend key glyphs

In most cases the default glyphs shown in the legend key will be appropriate to the layer and the aesthetic. Line plots of different colours will show up as lines of different colours in the legend, boxplots will appear as small boxplots in the legend, and so on. Should you need to override this behaviour, the `key_glyph` argument can be used to associate a particular layer with a different kind of glyph. For example:

`r columns(2, 1/2)`
```{r}
base <- ggplot(economics, aes(date, psavert, color = "savings"))

base + geom_line()
base + geom_line(key_glyph = "timeseries")
```

More precisely, each geom is associated with a function such as `draw_key_path()`, `draw_key_boxplot()` or `draw_key_path()` which is responsible for drawing the key when the legend is created. You can pass the desired key drawing function directly: for example, `base + geom_line(key_glyph = draw_key_timeseries)` would also produce the plot shown above right.



### Exercises

1.  How do you make legends appear to the left of the plot?

1.  What's gone wrong with this plot? How could you fix it?

    `r columns(1, 2 / 3)`
    ```{r}
    ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
      geom_point(aes(colour = drv, shape = drv)) + 
      scale_colour_discrete("Drive train")
    ```

1.  Can you recreate the code for this plot?

    `r columns(1, 2 / 3)`
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
      geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) + 
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
      theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
      guides(colour = guide_legend(nrow = 1))
    ```
