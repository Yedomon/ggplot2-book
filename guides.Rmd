# Legends and axes {#guides}


## Guides: legends and axes {#guidesss}

The component of a scale that you're most likely to want to modify is the __guide__, the axis or legend associated with the scale. Guides allow you to read observations from the plot and map them back to their original values. In ggplot2, guides are produced automatically based on the layers in your plot. This is very different to base R graphics, where you are responsible for drawing the legends by hand. In ggplot2, you don't directly control the legend; instead you set up the data so that there's a clear mapping between data and aesthetics, and a legend is generated for you automatically. This can be frustrating when you first start using ggplot2, but once you get the hang of it, you'll find that it saves you time, and there is little you cannot do. If you're struggling to get the legend you want, it's likely that your data is in the wrong form. 

You might find it surprising that axes and legends are the same type of thing, but while they look very different there are many natural correspondences between the two, as shown in table below and in Figure \@ref(fig:guides). \index{Guides} \index{Legend} \index{Axis}

```{r guides, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Axis and legend components."}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/scale-guides.png", dpi = 300, auto_pdf = TRUE)
```


| Axis              | Legend        | Argument name
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------
| Label             | Title         | `name`          
| Ticks & grid line | Key           | `breaks`        
| Tick label        | Key label     | `labels`        


The following sections covers each of the `name`, `breaks` and `labels` arguments in more detail.

### Scale title

The first argument to the scale function, `name`, is the axes/legend title. You can supply text strings (using `\n` for line breaks) or mathematical expressions in `quote()` (as described in `?plotmath`):  \index{Axis!title} \index{Legend!title}
    
`r columns(2, 1 / 2)`
```{r guide-names}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 1, z = "a")
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
p + scale_x_continuous("X axis")
p + scale_x_continuous(quote(a + mathematical ^ expression))
```

Because tweaking these labels is such a common task, there are three 
helpers that save you some typing: `xlab()`, `ylab()` and `labs()`:

```{r guide-names-helper}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(aes(colour = z))
p + 
  xlab("X axis") + 
  ylab("Y axis")
p + labs(x = "X axis", y = "Y axis", colour = "Colour\nlegend")
```

There are two ways to remove the axis label. Setting it to `""` omits the label, but still allocates space; `NULL` removes the label and its space. Look closely at the left and bottom borders of the following two plots. I've drawn a grey rectangle around the plot to make it easier to see the difference.

```{r guide-names-remove}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(colour = "grey50"))
p + labs(x = "",  y = "")
p + labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
```

### Breaks and labels

The `breaks` argument controls which values appear as tick marks on axes and keys on legends. Each break has an associated label, controlled by the `labels` argument. If you set `labels`, you must also set `breaks`; otherwise, if data changes, the breaks will no longer align with the labels. \index{Axis!ticks} \index{Axis!breaks} \index{Axis!labels} \index{Legend!keys}

The following code shows some basic examples for both axes and legends.

`r columns(3, 2/3)`
```{r breaks-labels}
df <- data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5) * 1000, y = 1)
axs <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
axs
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000))
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000), labels = c("2k", "4k"))
```

```{r}
leg <- ggplot(df, aes(y, x, fill = x)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
leg
leg + scale_fill_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000))
leg + scale_fill_continuous(breaks = c(2000, 4000), labels = c("2k", "4k"))
```

If you want to relabel the breaks in a categorical scale, you can use a named labels vector:

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
ggplot(df2, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point()
ggplot(df2, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c(a = "apple", b = "banana", c = "carrot"))
```

To suppress breaks (and for axes, grid lines) or labels, set them to `NULL`:

```{r axs-breaks-hide}
axs + scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL)
axs + scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL)
```
```{r leg-breaks-hide}
leg + scale_fill_continuous(breaks = NULL)
leg + scale_fill_continuous(labels = NULL)
```

Additionally, you can supply a function to `breaks` or `labels`. The `breaks` function should have one argument, the limits (a numeric vector of length two), and should return a numeric vector of breaks. The `labels` function should accept a numeric vector of breaks and return a character vector of labels (the same length as the input). The scales package provides a number of useful labelling functions:

* `scales::comma_format()` adds commas to make it easier to read large numbers.

* `scales::unit_format(unit, scale)` adds a unit suffix, optionally scaling.

* `scales::dollar_format(prefix, suffix)` displays currency values, rounding 
   to two decimal places and adding a prefix or suffix.

* `scales::wrap_format()` wraps long labels into multiple lines.

See the documentation of the scales package for more details.

`r columns(3)`
```{r breaks-functions}
axs + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())
axs + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = "$"))
leg + scale_fill_continuous(labels = scales::unit_format(unit = "k", scale = 1e-3))
```

You can adjust the minor breaks (the faint grid lines that appear between the major grid lines) by supplying a numeric vector of positions to the `minor_breaks` argument. This is particularly useful for log scales: \index{Minor breaks}

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = c(2, 3, 5, 10, 200, 3000), y = 1)
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10()

mb <- as.numeric(1:10 %o% 10 ^ (0:4))
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10(minor_breaks = mb)
```

Note the use of `%o%` to quickly generate the multiplication table, and that the minor breaks must be supplied on the transformed scale. \index{Log!ticks}

### Exercises

1.  Recreate the following graphic:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + 
      geom_point() +  
      scale_x_continuous("Displacement", labels = scales::unit_format(suffix = "L")) + 
      scale_y_continuous(quote(paste("Highway ", (frac(miles, gallon))))) 
    ```
    
    Adjust the y axis label so that the parentheses are the right size.

    `breaks` argument. How do `breaks` and `labels` differ?

      geom_point(aes(colour = drv)) +  
      scale_colour_discrete(labels = drv_labels)
    ```

1.  What label function allows you to create mathematical expressions?
    What label function converts 1 to 1st, 2 to 2nd, and so on?
    
1.  What are the three most important arguments that apply to both 
    axes and legends? What do they do? Compare and contrast their
    operation for axes vs. legends.

## Legends {#legends}

While the most important parameters are shared between axes and legends, there are some extra options that only apply to legends. Legends are more complicated than axes because: \index{Legend}

1.  A legend can display multiple aesthetics (e.g. colour and shape), from
    multiple layers, and the symbol displayed in a legend varies based on the
    geom used in the layer.
   
1.  Axes always appear in the same place. Legends can appear in different 
    places, so you need some global way of controlling them.
  
1.  Legends have considerably more details that can be tweaked: should they
    be displayed vertically or horizontally? How many columns? How big should
    the keys be?
    
The following sections describe the options that control these interactions.

### Layers and legends {#sub-layers-legends}

A legend may need to draw symbols from multiple layers. For example, if you've mapped colour to both points and lines, the keys will show both points and lines. If you've mapped fill colour, you get a rectangle. Note the way the legend varies in the plots below:

`r columns(3)`
```{r legend-geom, echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 1:3, z = letters[1:3])
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y, colour = z))
p + geom_point()
p + geom_point() + geom_path(aes(group = 1))
p + geom_raster(aes(fill = z))
```

By default, a layer will only appear if the corresponding aesthetic is mapped to a variable with `aes()`. You can override whether or not a layer appears in the legend with `show.legend`: `FALSE` to prevent a layer from ever appearing in the legend; `TRUE` forces it to appear when it otherwise wouldn't. Using `TRUE` can be useful in conjunction with the following trick to make points stand out:

`r columns(2, 2/3)`
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(y, y)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, colour = "grey20") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 2) 
ggplot(df, aes(y, y)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, colour = "grey20", show.legend = TRUE) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 2) 
```

Sometimes you want the geoms in the legend to display differently to the geoms in the plot. This is particularly useful when you've used transparency or size to deal with moderate overplotting and also used colour in the plot. You can do this using the `override.aes` parameter of `guide_legend()`, which you'll learn more about shortly. \indexf{override.aes}

```{r}
norm <- data.frame(x = rnorm(1000), y = rnorm(1000))
norm$z <- cut(norm$x, 3, labels = c("a", "b", "c"))
ggplot(norm, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), alpha = 0.1)
ggplot(norm, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), alpha = 0.1) + 
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
```

ggplot2 tries to use the fewest number of legends to accurately convey the aesthetics used in the plot. It does this by combining legends where the same variable is mapped to different aesthetics. The figure below shows how this works for points: if both colour and shape are mapped to the same variable, then only a single legend is necessary. \index{Legend!merging}

`r columns(3)`
```{r legend-merge}
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(aes(colour = z))
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(aes(shape = z))
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(aes(shape = z, colour = z))
```

In order for legends to be merged, they must have the same `name`. So if you change the name of one of the scales, you'll need to change it for all of them.

### Legend layout {#legend-layout}

A number of settings that affect the overall display of the legends are controlled through the theme system. You'll learn more about that in Section \@ref(themes), but for now, all you need to know is that you modify theme settings with the `theme()` function. \index{Themes!legend} 

The position and justification of legends are controlled by the theme setting `legend.position`, which takes values "right", "left", "top", "bottom", or "none" (no legend). \index{Legend!layout}

`r columns(3, 2/3)`
```{r legend-position}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 1:3, z = c("a", "b", "c"))
base <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 3) + 
  xlab(NULL) + 
  ylab(NULL)

base + theme(legend.position = "right") # the default 
base + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
base + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Switching between left/right and top/bottom modifies how the keys in each legend are laid out (horizontal or vertically), and how multiple legends are stacked (horizontal or vertically). If needed, you can adjust those options independently:

* `legend.direction`: layout of items in legends ("horizontal" or "vertical").

* `legend.box`: arrangement of multiple legends ("horizontal" or "vertical").

* `legend.box.just`: justification of each legend within the overall bounding 
   box, when there are multiple legends ("top", "bottom", "left", or "right").

Alternatively, if there's a lot of blank space in your plot you might want to place the legend inside the plot. You can do this by setting `legend.position` to a numeric vector of length two. The numbers represent a relative location in the panel area: `c(0, 1)` is the top-left corner and `c(1, 0)` is the bottom-right corner. You control which corner of the legend the `legend.position` refers to with `legend.justification`, which is specified in a similar way. Unfortunately positioning the legend exactly where you want it requires a lot of trial and error.

`r columns(3, 1)`
```{r legend-position-man}
base <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = z), size = 3)

base + theme(legend.position = c(0, 1), legend.justification = c(0, 1))
base + theme(legend.position = c(0.5, 0.5), legend.justification = c(0.5, 0.5))
base + theme(legend.position = c(1, 0), legend.justification = c(1, 0))
```

There's also a margin around the legends, which you can suppress with `legend.margin = unit(0, "mm")`.

### Guide functions

The guide functions, `guide_colourbar()` and `guide_legend()`, offer additional control over the fine details of the legend. Legend guides can be used for any aesthetic (discrete or continuous) while the colour bar guide can only be used with continuous colour scales. 

You can override the default guide using the `guide` argument of the corresponding scale function, or more conveniently, the `guides()` helper function. `guides()` works like `labs()`: you can override the default guide associated with each aesthetic. 

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 1:3, z = 1:3)
base <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_raster(aes(fill = z))
base 
base + scale_fill_continuous(guide = guide_legend())
base + guides(fill = guide_legend())
```

Both functions have numerous examples in their documentation help pages that illustrate all of their arguments. Most of the arguments to the guide function control the fine level details of the text colour, size, font etc. You'll learn about those in the themes chapter. Here I'll focus on the most important arguments.

#### `guide_legend()`

The legend guide displays individual keys in a table. The most useful options are: \index{Legend!guide}

*   `nrow` or `ncol` which specify the dimensions of the table. `byrow` 
    controls how the table is filled: `FALSE` fills it by column (the default),
    `TRUE` fills it by row.

    `r columns(3)`
    ```{r legend-rows-cols}
    df <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 1:4, z = letters[1:4])
    # Base plot
    p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_raster(aes(fill = z))
    p
    p + guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2))
    p + guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
    ```

*   `reverse` reverses the order of the keys. This is particularly useful when 
    you have stacked bars because the default stacking and legend orders are
    different:
    
    ```{r}
    p <- ggplot(df, aes(1, y)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = z))
    p
    p + guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))
    ```

*   `override.aes`: override some of the aesthetic settings derived from each
    layer. This is useful if you want to make the elements in the legend 
    more visually prominent. See discussion in 
    Section \@ref(sub-layers-legends).

*   `keywidth` and `keyheight` (along with `default.unit`) allow you to specify
    the size of the keys. These are grid units, e.g. `unit(1, "cm")`.

#### `guide_colourbar`

The colour bar guide is designed for continuous ranges of colors---as its name implies, it outputs a rectangle over which the color gradient varies.  The most important arguments are: \index{Legend!colour bar} \index{Colour bar}

* `barwidth` and `barheight` (along with `default.unit`) allow you to specify
   the size of the bar. These are grid units, e.g. `unit(1, "cm")`.
  
* `nbin` controls the number of slices. You may want to increase this from
  the default value of 20 if you draw a very long bar.

* `reverse` flips the colour bar to put the lowest values at the top.

These options are illustrated below:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1, y = 1:4, z = 4:1)
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = z))

p
p + guides(fill = guide_colorbar(reverse = TRUE))
p + guides(fill = guide_colorbar(barheight = unit(4, "cm")))
```
